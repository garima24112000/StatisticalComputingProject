Global CO₂ Emissions and Economic Indicators Analysis
Project Overview
This project investigates the evolving relationships between CO₂ emissions and economic indicators over time. The central research question is:

"How have the relationships between CO₂ emissions and economic indicators changed over time since 1982, and are there identifiable breakpoints that correspond to notable global economic or policy events?"

The analysis uses a global panel dataset of annual observations (from 1982 onward), aggregated by country, to model the impact of key predictors—including CO₂ emissions, cement CO₂, land use change CO₂, and population—on the logarithm of GDP. Structural break testing is used to determine whether shifts in these relationships align with important global events.
